# -Underwater-Pipeline-Detection-using-computer-vision
We have chosen a research paper (A Classical Computer Vision Pipeline for Underwater Detection of Long, Flexible, and Highly Deformable Curvilinear Objects) based on which we have developed this project. Our purpose of this project is to build a robust and dynamic pipeline for underwater images of pipelines and power lines. As underwater images are of not so good quality and photos vary in nature largely. If we have to build an algorithm that takes underwater images as input and gives judgment on pipelines or power lines. Then, we want the images to be as good so that the algorithm can easily detect objects with higher accuracy. Thatâ€™s why, before sending images to the algorithm, we need to make changes to images so that the algorithm can detect certain types of features to give output. As we are dealing with long objects, so we want these to be visible as edges. We are not choosing a deep learning approach here. Our analysis is based on Classical Computer Vision Techniques.
